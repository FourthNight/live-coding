# #Synthtober 2018

A collection of [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net) noodling and experimentation, coded over the course of October 2018.

Thanks to [Factoid](https://github.com/Factoid) for the inspiration :smile:

The pieces may be short loops, tunes in various states of completion, sound effect tests, etc.

"*Like #inktober, but less graphic."*\*
