# TOPLAP15

The files here contain the code I used for a [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net) music live coding performance as part of the [TOPLAP](https://toplap.org/) 15th birthday celebrations.

Each file contains a separate musical idea, many of which I had originally intended on extending or taking in different directions.
However, for the purposes of the TOPLAP performance I made them flow together as-is.
As such, there are several bits of code in here that I did not end up fully using, due partly to time constraints.

The code is in its end-of-performance state.
